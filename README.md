# Golang Machine Learning Pipeline

This demo project was created to demonstrate how to create a simple machine learning pipeline using pure Golang.

This project is build on a microservices architecture and utilities various technologies to implement a fully functional basic machine learning pipeline, including data ingestion, data processing, model training, model deployment and model prediction with caching.
